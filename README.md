My first React JS App

A simple appointment calendar

Features:

You can add an appointment to the current date or for a future date, one per day
By entering the day in the form and changing the text you can edit an appointment
You can delete appointments


Full disclosure: I worked on this after business hours in my spare time and it is my first foray into the world of React JS, the code is not as elegant as I'd like it to be, however I'm sure after a few more weeks of studying I can make something much greater.
